# Community Code of Conduct

We are committed to creating a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone. To ensure this, we have established the following guidelines, which we expect all community members to follow.

## 1. Be Respectful
Treat everyone with respect. Do not engage in abusive, derogatory, or disrespectful behavior. This applies to all forms of communication, whether written or verbal.

## 2. Be Inclusive
We welcome people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, individuals of different gender identities, sexual orientations, abilities, ethnicities, and religions. Any behavior that excludes or discriminates against others will not be tolerated.

## 3. Be Constructive
Keep conversations and feedback productive and focused. When giving feedback, aim to help others improve rather than criticize destructively. Focus on solutions, not problems.

## 4. No Harassment
Harassment, including but not limited to bullying, stalking, intimidation, or inappropriate physical contact, is not allowed. This applies both to online interactions and in-person events.

## 5. Respect Privacy
Do not share private or personal information of others without their explicit consent. Always respect the privacy of your fellow community members.

## 6. Handle Disagreements Professionally
Disagreements are inevitable, but they should be handled professionally. Attack the idea, not the person. Be open to constructive debate and differing viewpoints, but refrain from personal attacks.

## 7. No Spamming or Self-Promotion
Do not spam the community with irrelevant links, advertisements, or promotions. Self-promotion is allowed only if it adds value to the ongoing discussions and is in line with community rules.

## 8. Reporting Issues
If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to [Community Admins/Moderators]. All reports will be handled with confidentiality and taken seriously.

## 9. Consequences of Violations
Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the community, depending on the severity of the offense.

## 10. Be Kind
Be kind and encouraging to others. A positive community is built on supportive interactions and empathy.
